# IRC (`pi irc`)

Implemented under `packages/coding-agent/src/irc/`.

`pi irc` joins an IRC network as a bot. Every channel it is in (and every DM
peer) has its own agent session, running in this process on the same
`AgentSession` runtime as interactive mode — so **installed pi extensions
load and work**. When the `mcpJs` setting names a coordinator, each channel's
`read`, `write`, and `run_js` act on that channel's own mcp-js filesystem
snapshot instead of the host, and pi's host file tools are switched off.

    pi irc --server irc.example --port 6667 --nick pi

## Extensions

Sessions load whatever is installed for the agent directory, so

    pi install npm:pi-schedule-prompt

gives every channel the extension's tools; a scheduled prompt fires into the
channel it was scheduled from. Extensions that register slash commands or
message renderers load without error, but those surfaces are inert here: the
bot has no TUI. `,reload` reloads them.

## Talking to it

In a channel the bot only reacts to lines that mention its nick: a leading
address (`pi: list the files`, `pi, …`, `@pi …`) is stripped, and a mention
anywhere else (`does pi know?`) sends the whole line. Matching is
case-insensitive on whole words, so `piano` and `api` are not mentions.
Unmentioned chatter is never a prompt. DMs are addressed by nature and always
count. Reacting to every channel line is an explicit opt-in (`--all` /
`IRC_RESPOND_TO_ALL=1`) and off by default. Each line becomes the prompt `[IRC #chan] <nick> text` to that
channel's Session. While a turn runs, further lines are delivered as steering.
The bot relays every completed assistant message as channel lines, and one
line per tool call and result (`[run_js] 3 lines: …`, `[read] → hi`).

## Commands

Comma-prefixed. Inside a mention every command works in any channel the bot
is in (`pi ,model astra`, `pi ,fork ptest2`); bare `,command` lines are
honored in the control channel (default `#pi`) and DMs. Channel arguments
may omit the `#` (`ptest2` means `#ptest2`) and lists are comma separated.
`,help` lists all of them.

Session commands act on the channel's own Session and are the same set the
terminal client has as `/model`, `/thinking`, `/compact`, `/reload`
(parser in `session-commands.ts`):

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `,model [query]` | No query: show the current model and the available ones. With a query: select the first model whose `provider/id name` contains it (case-insensitive), the same provider/id/name filter. |
| `,thinking [level]` | Set the thinking level (`off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`); no level cycles. |
| `,compact [instructions]` | Compact the Session context. |
| `,reload` | Reload the Session's plugins. |

Channel control commands:

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `,join #a,#b` | Join channels; each gets a new Session (or its remembered one). |
| `,fork [#a,#b]` | Join each channel with a Session forked from the channel the command was typed in. With no channel, forks into a fresh `#<channel>-<petname>` (for example `#clone-brave-otter`, names from `node-petname`, retried if taken). The conversation tree is copied with `SessionManagement.fork`; with an mcp-js coordinator the source's latest heap and filesystem snapshot are carried over too (`engine-fork.ts`). The bot replies `forked #pi -> #a (session …; heap and files carried over)` per target. |
| `,part #chan` | Leave; the Session is kept and reused on the next `,join`. |
| `,merge #child [ours\|theirs]` | Merge a forked child's files back into this channel's Session: a three-way merge (`POST /api/fs/merge`) with base = the fork point's snapshot (recorded in the state file as `forkBaseFs`), ours = this Session's latest snapshot, theirs = the child's latest. On success the merged snapshot is folded into this Session's log, so `run_js` and the file tools see it at once. Conflicting paths are reported; `ours` or `theirs` resolves them. |
| `,sessions` | List channel → session. |
| `,help` | Command reference. |

Channel → session mappings live in `<agentDir>/irc/channels.json`
(`PI_IRC_STATE_DIR` or `--state-dir`), so a restart rejoins every remembered
channel and reattaches its Session.

## Delegation tools

Under `pi irc` every session worker also gets three tools, registered only
when the presentation's loopback control endpoint is configured
(`PI_IRC_CONTROL_URL` / `PI_IRC_CONTROL_TOKEN`, set for the workers by the
`pi irc` process; `control.ts`, `tools.ts`):

- `spawn_channel({ prompt, name?, timeoutSeconds? })`: forks the calling
  channel into `#<channel>-<petname>` (or `name`), joins it, runs `prompt` as
  the child's turn (its tool calls and reply appear in the child channel),
  waits for the child's run to finish through the Session services (with a
  timeout that aborts the child and returns partial text), and returns the
  child's final answer, channel, and session id.
- `irc_send({ channel, text })`: posts to a channel the bot is in, rate
  limited and line split. A mention of the bot in the text prompts that
  channel's Session, attributed to the sending channel, so channels can talk
  to each other in the open.
- `merge_channel({ channel, strategy? })`: the `,merge` command as a tool.

## Configuration

Flags win over environment variables:

| Flag | Env | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--server` | `IRC_SERVER` | required |
| `--port` | `IRC_PORT` | 6667, or 6697 with TLS |
| `--tls` | `IRC_TLS` | off |
| `--nick` | `IRC_NICK` | `pi` |
| `--password` | `IRC_PASSWORD` | none (server PASS) |
| `--channels` | `IRC_CHANNELS` | control channel only |
| `--control-channel` | `IRC_CONTROL_CHANNEL` | `#pi` |
| `--all` | `IRC_RESPOND_TO_ALL` | off |
| `--state-dir` | `PI_IRC_STATE_DIR` | `<agentDir>/irc` |
| `--session-dir` | `PI_IRC_SESSION_DIR` | `<agentDir>/irc/sessions` |
| | `PI_IRC_GUEST_NETWORK`, `PI_IRC_GUEST_MODULES` | what the sandbox may reach, for the `run_js` description |

The sandbox itself comes from the `mcpJs` coordinator setting; see
[settings.md](settings.md).


## How it is built

- `channel-session.ts`: one `AgentSession` per channel. It builds the
  channel's session file, its mcp-js sandbox (named after the pi session id so
  forks can carry engine state), its tools, and calls `bindExtensions()` —
  which every host must do, because extensions initialize on the
  `session_start` it emits. It relays `message_end` and
  `tool_execution_start`/`_end` to the channel, so anything that prompts a
  session (a channel line, a spawned parent, a scheduled prompt) shows up.
- `tools.ts`: `read`/`write`/`run_js` over the channel's sandbox, replacing
  pi's host file tools (`noTools: "builtin"` keeps extension tools enabled),
  plus `spawn_channel`/`irc_send`/`merge_channel` closing over the bot.
- `bot.ts`: irc-framework client, message routing, commands, and a per-target
  send queue with spacing to stay under flood limits.
- `engine-fork.ts`: carries mcp-js filesystem state across `,fork` and merges
  it back for `,merge`, over the coordinator's HTTP API.

A fork inherits the parent's conversation, so it is told where it now lives
and `irc_send` refuses to post back to the parent unless the user asked for
that channel by name.

Tests: `test/irc.test.ts` (commands, mentions, formatting, petnames, store,
engine fork over a fake coordinator, config, CLI parsing) and
`test/irc-delegation.test.ts` (engine fork/merge, delegation tools, the
fork-reply policy).
